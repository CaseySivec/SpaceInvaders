# SpaceInvaders (Text-based)
A fixed shooter game in which the player controls a laser ship by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen to a specific column and firing at aliens.

The text-based game will print out the gamespace where '1's represent aliens, '-'s represent blank spaces, and 'S' represents the ship that the user will strategically move in order to target the aliens. The gameplay will prompt the user to either move their ship or fire at the alien. 

If user opts to move their ship, the game will ask which column they would like for the ship to move. The columns range from 0 to 9, and will display an error for any outlier numbers. If the user decides to fire, then an alien will disappear if they exist in the column of the ship. The objective of the game is to remove all aliens from the gamespace.

## How to execute the game on Eclipse
* Download all the files from this Github as a Zipped Download. Github will generate a zipped file download. Extract the files and move all files to your desktop for easy access. You may use another folder but you must make sure all the files are in the same folder. Open the Eclipse program and create a new Java Project. Import the files from your desktop to this Java Project. When all files have successfully imported over into the same Project on Eclipse, you are now ready to run the 'Main.java' file to start the game. 

## How to execute the game on Terminal
Download all the files from this Github as a Zipped Download. Github will generate a zipped file download. Extract the files and move all files to a folder. Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the files (MyFirstJavaProgram.java). Assume it's C:. Type 'javac FirstFileName.java' for each file name and press enter to compile your code. You will have to compile each file from Github. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption: The path variable is set). Now, type 'java Main' to run the game. You will be able to see the gamespace printed on the window.



## Hope you enjoy the game!
